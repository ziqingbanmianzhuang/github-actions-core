We offer a convenient versioning management approach for releasing software on GitHub.

<!--truncate-->

1. Manually create the first tag:

   ```shell
   git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "v0.0.1"
   git push origin v0.0.1
   ```

2. Create a pull request that adds the following job to GitHub Action

  ```yaml
  "on":
    pull_request:
    push:
      branches:
        - master

  jobs:
    push-release-tag:
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
      uses: paion-data/github-actions-core/.github/workflows/version-bump.yml@master
      with:
        user: QubitPi
        email: jack20220723@gmail.com
  ```

3. When the pull request is merged, the version bump action will automatically create and push a new version tag of
   `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.(`PATCH` + 1)

:::tip

Bumping the `MAJOR` or `MINOR` version still needs to be done manually using `git tag -a vx.x.x -m "vx.x.x"` command
given the assumption that agile software development will change patch version most frequently and almost always
